      "message": "just about the class name .. I know it was me who suggested MoreExecutors in the first place on our chat in IRC, but on looking at this again here, I realize that was stupid.. this is real intented as a drop-in replacement for java.util.concurrent.Executors (you could even add some of its other methods here too?) and not quite the same as com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors, which offers a few other things.. so would you mind to name it perhaps Executors2 or even just Executors after all?  Sorry!",
