# Interval (in milliseconds) when to check for JVM threads and deadlocks.
# If there are any deadlocks detected, then details about them are logged
# at level ERROR, and a full dump of all threads stack frames at WARN level.
#
# An interval of 0 (default) disables this functionality, as it causes JVM stop-the-world,
# which can span to tens of seconds when there are many threads in the plaform with deep
# stacks.
#
# threadsWatcherIntervalMS=0

# Maximum total number of expected JVM threads.
# If there are more threads than this detected, then all threads stack frames are logged WARN level.
# This is independent of deadlock detection, and serves to detect "unbound thread growth" at scale.
#
# maxThreads=1000

# Interval (in seconds) how often at maximum to log maxThreads
# maxThreadsMaxLogIntervalSecs=60

# Interval (in seconds) how often at maximum to log deadlocks

# Interval (in secs) at which the metrics are reported to local files in data/metrics directory
# An interval of 0 disables this
