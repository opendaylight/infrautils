/**
 * Execution Origin utility.
 *
 * <p>An "Execution Origin" identifies the first (original)
 * point of contact of an external event entering the system. That first event
 * typically leads to numerous subsequent internal events in a system, and the
 * point of such an ID is (only) to be able to correlate a series of such
 * internal events among themselves and back to the original first external
 * event.  All log messages automatically include this ID.
 *
 * <p>In the case of OpenDaylight, such "origins" include HTTP requests (which are
 * often from the nortbound APIs exposed by YANG RESTCONF, but not limited to),
 * or something like an incoming Thrift request from a router, or an OVSDB notification, etc.
 *
 * <p>An Origin ID is "unique" within a certain given time span, which is typically "long enough"
 * to correlate events. However it may "overflow" and repeat, at some point in time.  This is
 * dependent on the number of events (and thus the load of the system).  This implementation
 * issues an INFO level log indicating when such an overflow occurred.
