     * Useful because while CompletableFuture does have a
     * {@link CompletableFuture#completedFuture(Object)} static factory method
     * to obtain immediate non-exceptional value completion, it is missing a
     * static factory method like this. This is often useful, e.g. when catching
     * exceptions to transform into CompletableFuture to return, and saves the 3
     * lines to create a new instance, invoke the non-static
     * {@link CompletableFuture#completeExceptionally(Throwable)} and return the
     * completableFuture. (It's not possible to use chained invocation style,
     * because completeExceptionally does not return this but a boolean, which
     * is useless when requiring an immediately completed CompletionStage.)
