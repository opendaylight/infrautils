     * lines to create a new instance, invoke the non-static
     * {@link CompletableFuture#completeExceptionally(Throwable)} and return the
     * completableFuture. (It's not possible to use chained invocation style,
     * because completeExceptionally does not return this but a boolean, which
     * is useless when requiring an immediately completed CompletionStage.)
