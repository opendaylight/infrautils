That seems very weird, to me.  -- If you keep bugging me ;) with this JMX stuff, I\u0027m starting to wonder whether we should have the generic (non diagstatus specific) part of this elsewhere, e.g. in infrautils/common/util\u0027s org.opendaylight.infrautils.utils (or even inside a new org.opendaylight.infrautils.utils.management sub-package) - thoughts?",
