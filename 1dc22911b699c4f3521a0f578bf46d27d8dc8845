That seems very weird, to me.  -- If you keep bugging me ;) with this JMX stuff, I\u0027m starting to wonder whether we should have the generic (non diagstatus specific) part of this elsewhere, e.g. in infrautils/common/util\u0027s org.opendaylight.infrautils.utils (or even inside a new org.opendaylight.infrautils.utils.management sub-package) - thoughts?",

That should allow (but do test it..) to then use \u003creference-list id\u003d\"serviceStatusProviders\" instead of id\u003d\"list\" in diagstatus.xml - which will probably make a lot more sense to anyone reading this code in the future than the \"list\" will make to them... ;-) Thanks!",
