      "message": "I am against having a general JMX utility class/method for other apps in diagstatus-api, which is not even used by diagstatus itself.  This class should always have been in diagstatus-impl instead of -api from the start.  IFF we do have widespread general need for JMX utilities, then we sholdhave that in infrautils.utils.management.  However I do not believe that we have such a requirement.  And we should not create utilities which are unused.",
