      "message": "nice, thanks!  Sorry to be a PITA, but the RegExp like this has one drawback: Imagine, hypothetically that someone one day would change the implementation.  Or not so hypothetically, I\u0027m obviously thinking of c/77730.  The way it is now, if that implementation completely dropped timeStamp and statusTimestamp, this test would still pass! :( Hope you agree that is sub-optimal.  What I think you would really want to do is have a slightly different RegExp which just transforms \u0027\"timeStamp\": \"Fri Nov 16 17:34:26 IST 2018\"\u0027 to \u0027\"timeStamp\": \"DOES-NOT-MATTER\"\u0027, and then have that in the SERVICE_STATUS_SUMMARY - do you know what I mean?",
