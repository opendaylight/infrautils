      "message": "this is simply a cherry-pick from master .. I think a later commit then cleaned this up again on? Perhaps Faseela remember exactly what we did here better than I... but looking at https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/71168/2/diagstatus/impl/src/main/java/org/opendaylight/infrautils/diagstatus/internal/DiagStatusServiceMBeanImpl.java a see I pointed to https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/71197/ which I abandoned in favour of your https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/71184/ .. so let\u0027s cherry pick that one as well - so proposed in https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/73265/.  (BTW: I may well be forgetting other stuff which should also be back-ported here... you\u0027re more than welcome to double check and cherry-pick anything else related to this which you think would have value to also be on oxygen).",
