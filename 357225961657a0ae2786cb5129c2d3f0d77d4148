      "message": "actually.. on thinking about this again, for performance what you are suggesting isn\u0027t ideal - because with that change, just to appease SpotBugs for this special case instead of suppressing, we\u0027ll ALWAYS have to cost of String concat, instead of ONLY onFailure... is that really a good idea? Are you OK if I undo even the previous change and we get my original patch set in instead?",
