I did not know that \"syncing on \u0027this\u0027 is discouraged\", but that makes sense to me now, so just \"for the exercise\" I\u0027ll change this again.  \n\nPS: You could raise an Enhancement proposal issue for (or even directly contribute to), EP and FindBugs re. \"syncing on \u0027this\u0027 is discouraged\" ! ;-)",
