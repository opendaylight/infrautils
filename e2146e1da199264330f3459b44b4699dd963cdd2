      "message": "Erm.. I\u0027m not sure what exactly you mean, how do you define \"test code\" precisely?  The odlparent.bundles4test.TestBundleDiag stuff is currently initially just used by the build in SingleFeatureTest, yes, (and has been well tested there over the last few months!), but.. so what?  Ultimately it\u0027s still just... well, code.  It checks bundle state and what not.  Do you have any more specific actionable objection what problems using this could cause?  According to my initial local tests, this works just great! ;-) What\u0027s the actual issue you see with this?",

In fact you could just create a Thread directly instead of using a single-threaded executor.",

      "message": "OK but how do you do that?  if you rethrow from here, it just goes into the uncaughtExceptionHandler of the Thread - not \"to the JVM\" (what does that mean?) .. As it\u0027s now, the org.opendaylight.infrautils.utils.concurrent.Executors uses org.opendaylight.infrautils.utils.concurrent.ThreadFactoryProvider which runs this in a Thread that has a org.opendaylight.infrautils.utils.concurrent.LoggingThreadUncaughtExceptionHandler .. but we anyway just logged it here, so AFAIK all a \"throw throwable\" here would add is to make the same appear twice in the log (which is always confusing), without adding any other real value.  Can you enlighten me what I am missing, so I can learn something?",
