      "message": "cauz in CacheConfig for the ID we currently have AZ09DOT_REGEXP whereas in c/67535 there are validations which require further constraining to AZ09_LOWERCASE_REGEXP and AZ_09_REGEXP (because of https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/).  That leaves only AZ09_REGEXP as not actually currently (or about to) be used.. it seemed useful to be me for future use, but if I need to remove that for a +1 then I could do that... ;-) Or you could +1 it as is - up to you!",
