      "message": "Stephen, that is the least of my concerns - not sure why -1 because of that... I can remove this here, if that would let you +1 it?  The real issue on this one, as per INFRAUTILS-41, is that it really needs c/72236 and a a new odlparent release to be able to proceed... odlparent is blocking this now (not because of ODLPARENT-136; forget that, who cares).",

      "message": "-1 just means “I would prefer that you didn’t submit this”, I found it odd that this section was being added when ODLPARENT-136 is already fixed, that’s all. I’ve noticed that review comments tend to go unnoticed if they’re not accompanied by a -1; if you’d rather I just left comments without leaving a “Code-Review” in Gerrit parlance, I can do that too...\n\nc/72236 has a comment from Robert which you haven’t addressed (case in point?).",
