     * scenarios a cache API client just invokes {@link Cache#get(Object)} (or {@link CheckedCache#get(Object)},
     * which then internally (may) use the {@link CacheFunction} (or {@link CheckedCacheFunction}) - without you
     * ever having had to explicitly <i>put</i> something into the Cache.
     *
     * <p>This method is <b>ONLY</b> (!) intended for "optimizations". It is useful if the code
     * using a cache already has a key and value (e.g. following an external update
     * notification event kind of thing) and wants to "save time" on an expected
     * subsequent {@link Cache#get(Object)} (or {@link CheckedCache#get(Object)}
     * invoking the {@link CacheFunction} (or {@link CheckedCacheFunction})
     * unnecessarily, using this "hint" to "propose" an entry to the cache.
     *
     * <p>Any code using this must expect key/value pairs that have been put into a
     * cache to disappear at any time (e.g. when the cache is full and this
     * key/value hasn't been used, or after a programmatic or end-user operator
     * initiated eviction), and be able to obtain <b>THE SAME</b> value from the
     * {@link CacheFunction} (or {@link CheckedCacheFunction}), for the given key.
     *
     * <p>Failure to implement calls to this put method consistent with the implementation
     * of the cache's get function <b>WILL</b> lead to weird cache inconsistencies!
     *
     * <p>Some Cache implementations may <b>IGNORE</b> this "hint" method.
     *
