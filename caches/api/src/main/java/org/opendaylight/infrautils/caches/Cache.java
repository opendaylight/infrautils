/**
 * Cache of keys to values.
 *
 * <p>Users typically obtain implementations from the {@link CacheProvider}.
 *
 * <p><b>Caches are not {@link Map}s!</b> Differences include that a <i>Map persists
 * all elements that are added to it until they are explicitly removed. A Cache on the
 * other hand is generally configured to evict entries automatically, in order to constrain
 * its memory footprint</i>, based on some policy (quoted from
 * <a href="https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki">Caffeine's</a> or
 * <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained">Guava's</a>
 * introduction).  Another notable difference, enforced by this caching API, is
 * that caches should <b>not</b> be thought of as data structures that you <i>put</i>
 * something in somewhere in your code to <i>get</i> it out of somewhere else.  Instead, a
 * Cache is "just a fa√ßade" to a {@link CacheFunction}'s <i>get</i>.  This design enforces
 * proper encapsulation, and helps you not to screw up the content of your cache (like you
 * easily can, and usually do, when you use a Map as a cache).
 *
 * <p>The implementation of this API is, typically, backed by established cache frameworks,
 * such as Ehcache, Infinispan, Guava's, Caffeine, ..., imcache, cache2k, ... etc.
 *
 * @param <K> key type of cache (must be immutable and have correct hashCode &amp; equals)
 * @param <V> value type of cache (should, for monitoring and predictable memory
 *            effect of eviction, typically, be of "similar" size for all keys;
 *            else consider simply using separate Cache, if feasible)
