      "message": "This is an interesting idea, but it sort of completely defeats the original purpose of this test... ;-) By doing this, we\u0027re no longer able to really test that this stuff works on both IPv4 and IPv6 - you\u0027re \"short cutting\" it, and as-is now, only really proving that getRemoteStatusSummary() includes the inetAddress - this basically just covers the  String concatenation, not that the DiagStatusCommand does a correct fetching of the diagstatus (which it did before via JMX, and still should now, just by HTTP).  https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/77902/ will let you do that though, see https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/#/c/75438/ for how to use.",
