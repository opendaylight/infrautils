      "message": "That\u0027s a great point.. wanted to \"fix\" this, but wasn\u0027t really sure how to best calculate an appropriate poll interval .. at first was going to do like timeout/5 (or /10) - but that\u0027s dumb - if you make it 60s timeout, then it\u0027s going to wait for too long, before even first trying. Then I thought of something like if (timeout \u003c 100) pollInterval \u003d 10 else if (timeout \u003c 500) pollInterval \u003d 100 else pollInterval \u003d 250, that\u0027s probabably better than a division, but I\u0027m not if there\u0027s even better .. interested in suggestions.",
