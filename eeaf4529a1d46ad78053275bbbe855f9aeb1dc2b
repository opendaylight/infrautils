I was thinking it needs to be done in this class otherwise we may see race conditions. Also this bundle needs to have a lower start-level than normal. That will guarantee the static DataStoreJobCoordinator is created before any user bundle activates and starts BP.",

      "message": "Yeah exactly, see latest patch set over in c/60303, where you\u0027l find this Activator.getJobCoordinator() used in DataStoreJobCoordinator getInstance().  Sorry for confusing you with out-of-order message delivery! ;)\n\nRe. race conditions, how about just making this get() here \" synchronized\" just in case, would that work for you?\n\nRe. lower start-level, that\u0027s a PITA to do (how/where?!), and unless proven otherwise with a failure, I doubt that\u0027s neccessary... even if OSGi were to start this bundle (jobcoordinator-impl) AFTER mdsalutil-api with DataStoreJobCoordinator, that would not be a problem - note that I\u0027m not relying on start() being called here.. getJobCoordinator() -\u003e static get() - all good! Agreed?",
