      "message": "The only thing with component-managed is that it doesn\u0027t call the update-method initially on startup or at least it didn\u0027t  in the past. Have you tested that? If it doesn\u0027t then you need to also use:\n\n  \u003ccm:cm-properties id\u003d\"...\"\n                  persistent-id\u003d\"org.opendaylight.infrautils.metrics\"/\u003e\n\nand inject into Configuration. I believe the cm-properties bean yields a Properties instance (if not then def a Map\u003cString, String\u003e).",
