      "message": "We could just return a (TBD) SystemReadyListenerRegistration here?  Avoids having an unregisterListener(), below.  More as an FYI: The reason there was originally no unregister() here is because it was really only built for boot features, without any plans to support Karaf feature uninstallation - that\u0027s completely broken everywhere, anyway.  Now if you still want to add an unregister just because, then fine by me.  Could also do this in a separate follow-up new change; because now you are already cramming 2 separate new ideas into this change; (a)  pass current SystemState to SystemReadyListener, and (b) un-registration.  If more is coming in new patch sets, best to split into separate Gerrits.  If just this, I\u0027m fine keeping it in this one.",
